An MCP server that provides a tool to fetch transcripts from YouTube videos. It first attempts to
retrieve a pre-existing, official transcript. If one is not available, it downloads the video's audio and uses OpenAI's
Whisper model for local AI-powered transcription.

This project is designed to be a simple, self-contained tool that can be easily integrated into any system capable of
communicating with an MCP server.

## Features

* **YouTube Video Search:** Finds the most relevant YouTube video based on a text query.
* **Official Transcript Priority:** Intelligently fetches manually created or auto-generated YouTube transcripts first
  for speed and accuracy.
* **AI-Powered Fallback:** If no official transcript exists, it automatically falls back to using OpenAI's Whisper
  `tiny` model to generate a high-quality transcript from the video's audio.
* **MCP Server Interface:** Exposes the transcription functionality as a simple tool (`get_youtube_transcript`) via the
  lightweight Meta Call Protocol.

## Requirements

* Python 3.12+
* **[uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv):** A fast Python package installer and resolver. You will need to [install
  `uv`](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv#installation) on your system first.
* **[FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html):** Must be installed and available in your system's PATH. OpenAI Whisper
  requires it to process audio files.

## Installation with `uv`

Using `uv` is recommended as it's extremely fast and handles both environment creation and package installation
seamlessly.

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/YouTubeTranscriber.git
   cd YouTubeTranscriber
   ```

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment:**
   This command creates a `.venv` folder in your project directory and activates it. `uv` will automatically use this
   environment for all subsequent commands.
   ```bash
   uv venv
   ```

3. **Install the project and its dependencies:**
   This command reads the `pyproject.toml` file and installs all required libraries into the virtual environment.
   ```bash
   uv sync
   ```

## Usage

### Running the MCP Server

Once installed, you can start the server by running the `mcp_server.py` script. The server will listen for JSON-RPC
requests on `stdin` and send responses to `stdout`.

```bash 
python mcp_server.py
``` 

The server will log its activity to a file named `mcp_server.log` in the project's root directory.

## Connecting to Gemini CLI on Windows

You can connect this MCP server to the Google Gemini CLI to use the function as a native tool directly from your
terminal. `get_youtube_transcript`
These instructions are for a **Windows** environment.

### Step 1: Create a Startup Script `run_server.bat`

The Gemini CLI needs a single, reliable command to start your server. A batch script is the perfect way to handle this
on Windows, as it ensures the correct virtual environment and Python interpreter are used.

1. Create a new file named in the root of your project directory. `run_server.bat`
2. Copy and paste the following content into the file:

``` batch
    @echo off
    REM This ensures the script's directory is the current directory
    cd /d "%~dp0"
    
    REM --- IMPORTANT ---
    REM Replace the path below with the ABSOLUTE path to your project's venv python.exe
    set PYTHON_EXE="C:\Users\jackp\.pyenv\pyenv-win\versions\3.12.10\python3.12.exe"
    
    echo --- Starting MCP Server using %PYTHON_EXE% ---
    %PYTHON_EXE% mcp_server.py
    
    pause
```

_This script activates the virtual environment in your project and then runs the server, ensuring all the correct
dependencies are available.`.venv`_

### Step 2: Configure the Gemini CLI

Now, you need to tell the Gemini CLI how to find and run your new server.

1. Locate your Gemini CLI `config.json` file. On Windows, this is typically found at:
   `C:\Users\<Your-Username>\.gemini\config.json`
2. Open the `config.json` file in a text editor. Add the following entry to the `mcpServers` object. If `mcpServers`
   doesn't exist, create it as shown below.

``` json
    {
      "mcpServers": {
        "youtube-transcriber": {
          "command": "C:\\Windows\\System32\\cmd.exe",
          "args": [
            "/c",
            "<path-to-your-project>\\run_server.bat"
          ],
          "cwd": "<path-to-your-project>"
        }
      }
    }
```

3. **Crucially, you must replace both instances of `<path-to-your-project>`** with the full, absolute path to where you
   cloned the `YouTubeTranscriber` repository.

**Example:** If your project is located at `C:\dev\YouTubeTranscriber`, the entry would look like this:

``` json
    {
      "mcpServers": {
        "youtube-transcriber": {
          "command": "C:\\Windows\\System32\\cmd.exe",
          "args": [
            "/c",
            "C:\\dev\\YouTubeTranscriber\\run_server.bat"
          ],
          "cwd": "C:\\dev\\YouTubeTranscriber"
        }
      }
    }
```

**Note**: JSON requires backslashes to be escaped, so you must use double backslashes (`\\`) in your paths.

### Step 3: Verify the Connection

After saving the `config.json` file, you can verify that Gemini CLI recognises and can use your new tool.

Gemini will now execute your `run_server.bat` script in the background, which starts the MCP server. It will then send
the request to the server, get the transcript, and display it as the answer to your prompt.

Run Gemini CLI and press ctrl+t

You should see `youtube-transcriber` listed as an available tool.

### MCP Client Example

You can interact with the server using any client that supports the MCP protocol over stdio. The server exposes one
primary tool: `get_youtube_transcript`.

Here is an example of a `call_tool` request to get a transcript for the query "What is an API? by MuleSoft".

**Request:**

```json 
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 1,
  "method": "call_tool",
  "params": {
    "name": "get_youtube_transcript",
    "arguments": {
      "query": "What is an API? by MuleSoft",
      "force_whisper": false
    }
  }
}
``` 

* `query`: The search term for the YouTube video.
* `force_whisper`: (Optional) A boolean that, if `true`, skips the check for an official transcript and generates one
  directly with Whisper. Defaults to `false`.

## Testing

This project includes a test suite to verify its functionality.

* **Core Function Test (`simple.py`):** This script tests the server's handler functions directly without needing to run
  a separate server process. It's the quickest way to check if the core logic is working.
  ```bash
  python simple.py
  ```

* **Full Server Test (`test_mcp.py`):** This script starts the MCP server as a subprocess and sends it live JSON-RPC
  requests, providing an end-to-end test of the server's functionality.
  ```bash
  python test_mcp.py
  ```

## Configuration

* **Logging:** Server activity is logged to `mcp_server.log`.
* **Audio Cache:** When Whisper is used, downloaded audio files are temporarily stored in `testing/audio_cache/`. You
  may wish to change this path in `youtube_tool.py` for a production environment.
